### Description
Git is a powerful version control system allowing to record, access, and restore
the history of projects. After setting up remotes on the internet or other
network, Git is also a mighty collaboration tool.

In this workshop, we will:
 * Explain what version control is and what the benefits are,
 * Get you started with Git,
 * Use the popular online Git repository hosting site GitHub to introduce a
   workflow typical of many companies.


### Prerequisites
 * Install Git:
   * Windows users: install Git for Windows from https://gitforwindows.org/
   * MacOS and Linux users: install Git from https://git-scm.com/downloads
   * Sign up for a free GitHub account at https://github.com/
 
 If you don't want to type your password all the time and if you feel up to the
 challenge, you can try to [set up SSH for your
 account](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)
