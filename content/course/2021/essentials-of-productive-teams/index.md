## Section 1: MITACS

### Description
More than ever, organizational success depends on people working together -
effectively. The pressure to communicate productively, quickly turn ideas into
profitable action and consistently deliver results never decreases. Using team
simulation exercises, participants work from a clear understanding of personal
strengths and an appreciation of the differences in others will be the
foundation of success in the future.

### Objective
To constitute an effective team, its members must share a common goal, have
respect for each other, and be motivated to use the strengths of each member to
achieve their objectives. Using team-based, hands-on, experiential learning
exercises, the objective of this one-day workshop is to provide participants
with an opportunity to build their ability and awareness participating in and
leading an effective team unit that meet deadlines and see results.

### Learning Outcomes
Through participating and completing this course, participants will:

 * Discover the key steps and competencies to build an efficient and effective
   team
 * Learn how to manage the barriers that keep teams from performing
 * Be able to apply the best practice of teams into daily communication

### Key Topic Areas
 * What is Team Building?
 * The importance of clarifying goals
 * Understanding conflict within teams
 * Building trust and accountability
 * Identifying issues
 * Team motivation & Action Plans
 * Resources

## Section 2: Tom O'Neil

### Title: Effective Team Member Behaviors Makes for High-Performance Teamwork

### Description
In this course you will learn about the importance of high-performance teamwork,
effective team member behaviors, conflict and conflict management, and goal
setting for personal development. This will be an evidence-based session drawing
on the research from the group dynamics literature. I will intersperse
interactive lecture-based formats with callouts, breakouts, virtual post it
boards, a conflict styles self-assessment, and other engaging activities. My
goal for you is to leave this session feeling better equipped to employ the soft
skills needed to be effective in team and collaboration-based settings.
