### Course Description
This course will build on your knowledge of Python to sharpen your skills for
data manipulation and analysis. We will use libraries such as pandas, numpy and
matplotlib to ingest, tidy and explore real world datasets and extract insights
from them. We will leverage the Jupyter notebook interface to help us work with
public APIs, combine multiple datasets and perform exploratory analysis. At the
end of the course you should feel comfortable working with unfamiliar datasets,
spotting common data errors and using visualizations to understand your data and
plan more detailed analysis.


### Programming Challenges

#### Session 1 
In this session we will review some basic programming problems and solve them
using python


#### Session 2
In this session we will build on the content of the python/jupyter course as
well as the first problem session and explore some more complex problems which
include external data sources.
