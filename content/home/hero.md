**August 3-27, 2021**

Together with our partners, [PIMS](https://www.pims.math.ca) is excited to offer
a 4-week virtual Math<sup>Industry</sup> workshop geared for graduate students
and postdoctoral fellows in the mathematical and statistical sciences to gain
the industry skills needed for success in their careers.

This workshop has two main objectives:

1. To build technical skills in programming and computational workflows
2. To build business skills for effective teamwork and technical report writing

Attendees will gain hands-on experience as part of a team working on a
real-world problem posed by an industry partner. If you're a graduate student, or
PDF interested in participating or if you're a PDF, instructor or faculty member
who is interested in mentoring, please get in touch.
