# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I'm an applied mathematician working somewhere in the gray area between research, development and application of novel sensor technologies, signal processing, data analysis and interpretation. I pride myself in understanding all levels of a system and being able to explain any of it to anyone. I'm equally comfortable buried in code, in the field or presenting tricky results at a high level.
