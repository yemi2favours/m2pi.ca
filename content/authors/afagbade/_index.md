Adeyemi Fagbade is currently a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Wyoming. 
My research seeks to answer challenging questions about continuous eddy simulation of turbulent single-multiphase flow and heat transfer via hybrid and realizability concepts.
Adeyemiâ€™s research uses hybrid methodologies and mathematical approaches to further develop and implement statistical turbulence modeling and
identifying a region of interest within the flow domain. His research investigations include but are not limited to CFD methods involving fluid-structure
interaction and resolved motion modeling in both porous and non-porous media.
