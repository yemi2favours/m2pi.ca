Currently my research activity revolves around realization problems in ordinary
and integral representation theory of groups and closely-related rings, which
include reality-based algebras/table algebras/adjacency algebras of association
schemes, as well as Hopf algebras/quantum groups. I have ongoing collaborative
projects on the representation theory of classical groups over finite local
rings.
