Noah is a recent graduate student from the University of Ottawa studying the effects of seasonaility on predator-prey scenarios. His work focuses on bistability and bifurcations
in ordinary differential equation models as well as averaging of discontinuous systems. He works mainly with MATLAB and XPPAUTO, but is also familiar with Python and R. His
interests lie in mathematical ecology, mainly in population dynamics, as well as mathematical modelling and numerical simulations.
