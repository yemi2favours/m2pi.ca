I, Dr. Edwin Walter Reid provide high quality engineering service targeted at
applications where leading edge design, high quality, reliable performance, and
clean packaging are critical success factors. This capability was gained by
managing a multitude of industrial research and development projects. I have
over 40 years of experience in the field of communications, power, and
industrial electronics. I currently hold three international patents on the
inductive-thermal dynamic stripping process used in the soil remediation and oil
industries.
