# Optimization of Employee Work Schedule,

### Vakhtang Putkaradze, Senior Director, Science and Technology, ATCO
 
Due to the outbreak of COVID-19 around the world, and government policies
implemented as a response to the outbreak, many corporations have chosen to let
their employees work from home to prevent the spread of the disease. In order
to safely re-open the economy, one of the recommendations from health
authorities is to allow only a limited percentage of workers in the workplace
at any specific time.  Given these constraints, it is useful for companies to
arrange  flexible work schedule so the employees go to offices during
reasonable working hours, and at the same time reduce their commute time to
improve their productivity. In this problem, you will help a model business to
design and optimize their employees’ working-at-office schedule using a
combination of criteria which you deem to be important, and real-life data such
as traffic, limitation on work schedule hours, commuting time and others.
