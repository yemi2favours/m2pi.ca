# Compressibility of the transaction graph for the proof-of-protocol in a blockchain

### German Luna Patiarroy, Lead Blockchain Developer, The Divi Project

The main limitation of blockchains is storage requirements, which would be alleviated if one could reversibly compress the data in a blockchain or in its underlying transaction graph.
* Determine to what extent a transaction graph can be compressed (for later decompression) or what obstructions exist to its compression.
* What compression ratio can you achieve for an ordered sequence of cryptographic hashes?

Pure Mathematics skills and experience with mathematical proof-writing are essential skills for this project.  Knowledge of undergraduate-level cryptography or Python programming skills would be assets, but are not required.
