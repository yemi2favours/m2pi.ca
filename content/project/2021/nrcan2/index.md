title: "NRCAN - Batch image analysis for automated classification of marked and unmarked beetles"

summary: |

  Existing techniques for insect mark and recapture studies can result in
  unnatural dispersal patterns. We have developed a new technique for marking
  insects as the emerge from which offers a much more natural dispersal pattern.

  The technique involves coating trees with a special paper which glows under
  ultra-violet light. The insects are marked with paper dust as they chew through the paper
  to emerge. Following recapture, they can be examined for traces of the paper
  under ultra-violet light.

  In this project we will work with images of insects marked using this
  technique and control images of unmarked insects. The problem is to conduct
  batch analysis of the images and classify them as  marked and unmarked to
  validate the new technique.

# Problem Statement

We have developed a new marking technique for mark‑recapture studies of the
mountain pine beetle. In traditional (typical) mark‑recapture studies insects
are collected and marked using fluorescent powders by shaking them in a jar to
coat them before releasing them en-masse from a central release point.
Obviously, dispersal resulting from this type of mass release is very unnatural.

Our technique involves by coating trees in paper, which emerging insects would
chew through as they emerge and thereby become marked by paper dust. This paper
dust fluoresces under black light. In this way beetles would become marked in a
much more natural way and would release themselves for later recapture.

A former student on this project imaged all of the beetles emerging from papered
trees and from control trees that were not papered under a light microscope
Illuminated with black light.

The workshop project challenge will be to conduct batch image analysis of a
large number of images in order to automate classification of beetles as marked
or unmarked. All available data will be made available for this project.

Once the images have been analyzed there is a classification problem and the
data could be divided into training and validation subsets to demonstrate
classification skill of an algorithm chosen by the team.
