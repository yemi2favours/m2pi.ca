  Developing optimal production and sustainability models for food supply chains
summary: |
  Producing food and other goods sustainability is the greatest challenge of our
  generation. To produce food sustainably there are many factors to consider
  including the types of crops, the inputs, organic vs. non-organic, use of
  fertilizer, food waste, transportation to market and other factors. The goal
  of this project is to develop a model which can take into account factors
  end-to-end in the food supply chain to inform decisions on methods (organic,
  traditional, vertical, etc.) and sustainability indicators (green house gases,
  etc.).

# Problem Statement

Producing food and other goods sustainability is the greatest challenge of our
generation. To produce food sustainably there are many factors to consider
including the types of crops, the inputs, organic vs. non-organic, use of
fertilizer, food waste, transportation to market and other factors. The goal of
this project is to develop a model which can take into account factors
end-to-end in the food supply chain to inform decisions on methods (organic,
traditional, vertical, etc.) and sustainability indicators (green house gases,
etc.).

### Data Sources
We will be using a combination of the following data sources:

  * Open data available from a variety of sources (i.e. USDA, AWS)
  * Data captured from IoT sensors
  * Satellite image data


### Technical Skills
  * Experience with Excel
  * Knowledge of Python or other coding languages
  * Familiarity with Internet of Things devices, i.e. Raspberry PI and sensors
