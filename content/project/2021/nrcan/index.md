subtitle: "Modelling Mountain Pine Beetle Dispersal"
summary: |
  Insect dispersal is often divided into two classes: local and long distance.
  Local dispersal is the most common dispersal mode and because many individuals
  disperse this way, it is well described by dispersal kernels. Long distance
  dispersal is more stochastic and difficult to model using dispersal kernels
  because only a small proportion of insects are thought to disperse long
  distances. For the mountain pine beetle for example, most individuals disperse
  between five and fifty meters from where they were born but about 0.2 percent
  of individuals end up above tree canopies where they can be pulled upwards by
  updrafts and then transported laterally by higher wind speeds in the lower
  atmosphere.

  Long-distance dispersal is likely the dominant determinant of the speed of
  mountain pine beetle invasions, but estimation of invasion speeds using
  standard mathematical approaches are impeded by the strong Allee effect. In
  this project, we will explore theoretical dispersion distributions and models
  to better estimate mountain pine beetle invasion speed.

Insect dispersal is often divided into two classes (perhaps somewhat
artificially): local and long distance. Local dispersal is the most common
dispersal mode and because many individuals disperse this way, it is well
described by dispersal kernels. Long distance dispersal is more stochastic and
difficult to model using dispersal kernels because only a small proportion of
insects are thought to disperse long distances. For the mountain pine beetle for
example, most individuals disperse between five and fifty meters from where they
were born. About 0.2 percent of individuals (Safranyik et al, 1991), however end
up above tree canopies where they can be pulled upwards by updrafts and then
transported laterally by higher wind speeds in the lower atmosphere. Mountain
pine beetles that disperse long distances would typically disperse 40 km on
average (Ainsley and Jackson, 2011) but specifics may vary depending on where
individuals are dispersing from. Long-distance dispersal is risky for mountain
pine beetles because if they disperse too far into locations where mountain pine
beetles are sparse, they are unable to recruit enough conspecifics to attack new
trees and they suffer the consequences of a strong Allee effect. Therefore,
although long-distance dispersal is likely the dominant determinant of the speed
of mountain pine beetle invasions, estimation of invasion speeds using standard
mathematical approaches are impeded by the strong Allee effect (we can no longer
rely on the linear conjecture—see Kot and Lewis et all., 1998). In addition, the
nature of long distance dispersal, in which individuals that disperse to the
invasion front are more likely to have dispersed from dense populations behind
the front of the invasion, combined with the Allee effect, implies that
traveling waves arising from the dynamics described above will be “pushed waves”
rather than “pulled waves”. Using two theoretical dispersal distributions
(potentially derived from the literature cited herein) and a population model
with a strong Allee effect in discrete time, develop an approach (mathematical
and/or simulation/based) for estimating invasion speed. If possible, demonstrate
that traveling waves subject to the biology described above are pushed rather
than pulled when they exist.
